# 2001

XXI century, the century of development of Internet technologies.
In 2001, I bought a dial-up modem and it gave me access to the Internet.

Internet was very slow and very expensive.
But it was all incredibly interesting. Sometimes I didn't sleep for days.

During this period, I actively studied low-level programming, the creation of viruses, network hacking methods and software cracking.

It probably looks stupid, but when I managed to hack something, I reported it and gave instructions on how to protect myself from hacking.
Many things really look criminal now, but in those days there were no laws that would restrict the Internet.

In addition to Visual Basic, I began to study the C language. In C, I made small console applications.

I started building my first "normal" Windows applications written in Visual Basic.

One of my first programs for Windows was Deinen Blick - an image viewer.
The name is in German, because I liked German and I studied it, on my own, like programming. Most likely Rammstein is to blame.
In fact, it was a terrible program, with a lot of graphic elements and a very strange interface.

Thanks to the Internet, I have a little more information about programming.
But all the same, offline sources of information dominated and there were few of them.

Trial and error is my way.
