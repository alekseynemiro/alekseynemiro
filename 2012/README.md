# 2012

In 2012, I brought to completion Arimsoft's project to search and booking for airline tickets using Galileo Web Services.
I was responsible for the entire backend, as well as the revitalization of the frontend based on the mockups provided by the customer.
In total, development took two years.

In May, I relocated from Yoshkar-Ola (Republic of Mari El, Russia) to St. Petersburg (Russia).

In November, using funds received from advertising on [Kbyte.Ru](../2010/assets/kbyte.md), I bought a licensed [Windows Web Server 2008](assets/windows2008.jpg).
I rented a physical server for my own projects.
It was  Intel Core i3–540 3.00 GHz (Clarkdale), RAM 4 GB DDR3, SATA 2 x 1 TB (7200), for $130 per month.
This allowed me to release an API for [FoxTools.ru](assets/foxtools.md).

In 2012 I also began to take my first steps in creating my own musical compositions.
