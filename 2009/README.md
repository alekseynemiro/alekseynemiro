# 2009

2009 was a year of changes.

I continued to work on the store project I received [last year](../2008).
The main difficulty of the project was the complexity of the data structure, its large volume, and limited server resources.

Working with limited resources has been a common problem in all the web projects I've been involved in.
This serious problem forced me to look for ways to optimize. And yes, my code was damn optimized.

I started developing a new version of [Kbyte.Ru](assets/kbyte.md) using ASP.NET MVC.
I used Visual Basic .NET as the programming language because this language was the most comfortable for the project community and I expected that someday someone would join the development of the project.

Also, I developed programs for Windows using Windows Forms (.NET Framework).
In the spring of 2009, I released [MyMoney](assets/mymoney.md) - a home accounting program.
I also wrote a small program for [managing an offline store](assets/myshop.md) for one friend.

I continued to work at Arimsoft. We developed affiliate program tools for selling company services.
These were APIs and HTML integration tools with the possibility of customization.
We used the new ASP.NET MVC framework for the first time.

On September 15, 2009, I left my hometown of Vladivostok.
I relocated to the city of Yoshkar-Ola (Republic of Mari El, Russia).
