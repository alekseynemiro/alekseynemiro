# 2005

2005 is the second year of my military service.

I was completely free and could do whatever I wanted. But there was one small problem.

I was in the forest, where there were nothing but trees, hills, and increased background radiation.

And most importantly, I did not have access to the Internet. I was fixed in the late 2003 state.

One of my friends sent me the Fedora distribution by mail. And I had my first serious experience with Unix systems.

I had a book on ASP.NET that my mother brought me when she was in Moscow. I started actively learning ASP.NET and began to develop my new web project dedicated to programming.

During this period of time, I could boast of excellent knowledge of Visual Basic 6.0. This is not difficult when technology stops developing.

Also, I developed programs, casual games, and components using Visual Basic 6.0.

I retired to the reserves in the fall of 2005 with the rank of starshina 2nd class (junior sergeant).
