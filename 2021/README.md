# 2021

In 2021 I continued to work.

I was interested in the architecture of large companies and the organization of workflows.

When many different people work in one place and move the company towards a certain goal, at the same time they may not even know each other.
To some extent, people can be compared to highly specialized robots (programs) that follow instructions and perform certain processes when conditions match.
This is really interesting.

By agreement with the company, my public activity was limited.

Besides work, I did some programming for myself.

I worked on desktop projects based on WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and Avalonia UI.

I was interested in the possibility of creating cross-platform applications.

I stopped working on my own web projects due to lack of time.
