# 2015

2015 was a year of development for me as a frontend developer and as a system administrator.

I was concerned about the high cost of using Microsoft technology. I was constantly looking for ways to optimize costs.

One such way was to use Mono with Unix-like systems.

To achieve my goal, I began to learn Unix-like systems especially Debian in more detail.
I used web servers Nginx and Apache. I also started learning Bash.

In addition, I administered my own Windows server and the company's Windows servers.

I have made significant progress in frontend development.
The client side of web projects became not just some code for me, but a separate application.
I used TypeScript and continued to use SCSS. I used MSBuild to build and bundle the client-side code.

In 2015, I released my implementation of a PHP engine for creating sites similar to ASP.NET WebForms.
The [VBNet.Su](../2008/assets/vbnet.md) project was created using early versions of this engine.

Also, I released a new API for [FoxTools.ru](assets/foxtools.md).
The new version of the API was implemented using the Web API (ASP.NET MVC, C#) and was freely available.
