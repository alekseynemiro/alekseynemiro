# 2007

2007 for me was the year of creating a team and working with my own customers.

A team was formed from some of the participants in the Kbyte.Ru project.
I looked for customers and negotiated terms, and then my team and I resolved the customer’s issues.
We had one programmer, one UI specialist, one SEO specialist, and myself.

During the year we worked with a dozen customers. However, our work was in the HTML/JavaScript/CSS and PHP technology stack.

Finding customers in the .NET stack was difficult. This is an enterprise stack, not a level for a fledgling team.

In July 2007, I released [Kbyte.Ru v4.0](assets/kbyte.md). The new version had multilingual support and expanded interface customization options.

In August, I released [my home page](assets/homepage.md), which was made in ASP.NET WebForms using C#. This was my first web project in C#.

At the end of summer, I found a customer with a large unfinished ASP.NET WebForms (C#) project. It was a social network project.
It was difficult for my team to work with C#, so I worked on the backend part of the project alone. The team helped with the frontend.
By the end of the year, the project began to choke. The legacy was terrible. It was clear that we would not pull it off. We also had no idea what we were doing.
We discussed the problem with the customer and he proposed to assemble a new team.
I didn't believe in success and refused.

This year was the last year I programmed in Visual Basic 6.0.
I returned to the [game engine project](../2003/assets/game) and made a [map editor](assets/MapEditor).
But it was clear that the time of VB 6.0 had passed and I concentrated on .NET.

In 2007, I first published my [article](articles/HttpWebRequestResponse.md) in the paper magazine for programmers RSDN.

And also I continued working at Arimsoft. We worked on creating new web projects in the field of travel.

We have integrated with various services providing travel services. Including: Amadeus, Tourico Holidays, GTA Travel, Acase, Galileo GDS, Sirena (in Russian: Сирена - СИстема РЕзервирования На Авиалиниях).
