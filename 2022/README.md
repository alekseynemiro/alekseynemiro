# 2022

2022 was a year of uncertainty and destruction. The COVID-delayed war has begun.

It was clear to me that I would not be able to continue working with a US company from Russia.

The company offered to change the location and leave Russia. But I didn't consider this option.

I had to get rid of my server in Germany because I finally lost the opportunity to pay for services from Russia.

I just deleted my web projects. I had neither the strength nor the desire to pull them out.

If web projects are not constantly supported and developed, they will inevitably become outdated. They simply exist, without any purpose.

I expected to quit by the end of the year, but the company convinced me to stay until the spring. And I stayed.
