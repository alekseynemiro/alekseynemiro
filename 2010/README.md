# 2010

2010 was a year of releases.

This year I stopped working with my own customers and concentrated on my own projects.

In the spring 2010 I released [Kbyte.Ru v5.0](assets/kbyte.md). The new version had a new concept and a new architecture.
Especially for this project, I bought a virtual server (Hyper-V) on Windows Server 2003 with 1 GB RAM.
This was the beginning of my real experience administering Windows servers.

In addition to the web server, I configured SQL Server, FTP, DNS, and mail server.

Active participants of the Kbyte.Ru project were allocated resources to host their own projects.

The new version of Kbyte.Ru contained a section of useful online tools.
In the summer I moved this section to a separate project. It was [FoxTools.ru](assets/foxtools.md).

To manage external links to Kbyte.Ru, I initially used an internal service.
In the autumn, I brought link generation to an external project - [goID.ru](assets/goid.md).

At the end of the year, I released a blogging platform - [BlogRay.ru](assets/blogray.md).

I also continued to work at Arimsoft.

This year I had experience integrating with different payment systems: PayPal, Platron, Assist.

I also had experience integrating with HotelsPro and RZD.
