# Drawing Hrous

In 2003, I [continued](../../2002/assets/drawing_hours.md) developing Drawing Hours and released the third version of the program.

This version continues the development of the skin file format. New opportunities have appeared in creating skins. The number of preinstalled skins has been increased.
