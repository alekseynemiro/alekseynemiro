# Flying in bottom

The goal of the game is to knock down falling cubes, the higher the cube, the more points you get.

In this game, I used full rendering of the interface and gameplay for the first time.

In my early games, I mostly used controls such as `PictureBox`, `Image`, `Command`, etc, and made animations using GIF files.
Here everything is completely drawn in real time, without using Visual Basic components.
