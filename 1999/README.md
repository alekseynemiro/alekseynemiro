# 1999

In 1999, I was in high school and continued to actively study Chinese implementations of the Basic languages.

During this period, I was fascinated by mathematics and I used Q-Basic to write programs that helped me solve mathematical problems.

I also did not give up trying to make games. However, the capabilities of the G-Basic language (special implementation of Basic for games) were not enough.

Apart from programming, I tried to use my 8-bit keyboard to create animations.

Just imagine, I had a TV screen at my disposal, where I could draw some images with huge "pixels", something like this:

```
    ████████████
  ████████████
  █          █
 ██  █    █  ██
█ █          █ █
 ██   ████   ██
   █        █
    ████████
```

I wrote code that drew one or more frames, and then I recorded the video on a VHS videotape.
Sometimes I separately added an audio stream from a tape recorder.
