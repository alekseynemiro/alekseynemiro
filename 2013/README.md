# 2013

In 2013, I created my first programming video tutorials to promote the [Kbyte.Ru](../2010/assets/kbyte.md) project.

I also began to pay more attention to client-side programming and my code was no longer a chaotic collection of script files but became more monolithic.

I continued the development of the API on the [FoxTools.ru](../2012/assets/foxtools.md) project.
I created a service for creating graphical snapshots of web pages, as well as storage for snapshots.
I also created a program for Windows that allowed users to take screenshots and send them to the Internet - [FoxTools Screen Shooter](https://github.com/foxtools-ru/screen-shooter).

At Arimsoft, we took on a new project that needed to be completed and brought to release.
This was an almost finished MVP (minimum viable product) of a classic enterprise project on ASP.NET MVC (Razor), C#, and SQL Server DBMS.
This was a project for searching and booking air tickets based on Travelport Universal API.
The main feature of the project was a fully automatic booking process, with minimal human intervention.

This year I also created my account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/alekseynemiro).

At the end of the year, I relocated from St. Petersburg (Russia) to Yoshkar-Ola (Republic of Mari El, Russia).
