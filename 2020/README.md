# 2020

In 2020, I continued my work at ClearScale.

De facto, our technical resources were unlimited.

This partly influenced my programming style.

On the backend side, I could use any low-performance tools and not think that it would work slowly or that we would not have enough resources.
We used cloud technologies. Our resources were truly unlimited.

But at the same time, I was responsible for the frontend, which worked on the client side. I paid a lot of attention to the performance of the client code.

Frontend is difficult because the tools are complex and there are no limitless resources like on the backend side.
And that's why it's interesting.

I was optimizing the client-side code and making sure that no one broke the optimization.

We released the first versions of the project this year.

It so happened that I became responsible for delivering hotfixes to prod and for releasing new versions of the project.

I was also responsible for the workflow for the GitHub repository.

I was involved in keeping the main branches up to date and also resolving conflicts in the code.

To automate some things, I created scripts in Bash and Node.js

One of these scripts eventually became a full-fledged console application.
**[bighut-relabel](https://github.com/sfm-tools/bighut-relabel)** was my first open-source npm package.
