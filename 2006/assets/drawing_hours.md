# Drawing Hours

In 2006, I released the latest version with major changes to the Drawing Hours program.

Drawing Hours 4.0 has improved the quality and quantity of skins and added support for plugins that significantly expand the capabilities of the program.

The program was written in Visual Basic 6.0.
