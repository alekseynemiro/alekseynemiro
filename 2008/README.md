# 2008

2008 can be called the year of automation, and the fight against bots, and also a bit of the year of PHP.

In my work, I often had to imitate user actions on websites.
No crime. It’s just that some of our partners did not have an API, but wanted to cooperate.
I actively developed my skills in working with web requests and regular expressions.

I also created bots to analyze web projects.

One of these bots was a program for searching for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection.
Subsequently, I wrote a short [article](articles/SQL_Injection.md) on this topic for RSDN magazine.

And of course I had to develop mechanisms to protect sites from bots.

In the spring, I found a customer with a store project in ASP.NET WebForms (VB).
But by this point my team had completely disintegrated.
I worked on the project alone.

I liked .NET technology, but in 2008 it was very expensive to maintain hosting, and especially a server for Windows projects.
I was looking for ways to cut costs.

One of the cost optimization solutions was to use PHP.

In 2008, I rewrote [my home page](assets/homepage.md) from [ASP.NET](../2007/assets/homepage.md) to PHP. This was my first own PHP web project.
Strictly speaking, I have used PHP before, including in commercial projects.
But it was my home page that became a truly full-fledged and complete PHP project, created from scratch.

At the end of the year I released another website in PHP - [VBNet.Su](assets/vbnet.md).

Also, this year I started writing articles for the paper magazine Hard'n'Soft on computer topics.
