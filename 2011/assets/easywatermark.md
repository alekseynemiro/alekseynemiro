# EasyWatermark

EasyWatermark is a Windows application designed for applying watermarks to photographs and images.

The program is written in Windows Forms, C# and consists of two parts:

* EasyWatermark - GUI application
* EasyWatermarkLib - .NET library for developers

I planned to create a new major version of the project, but unfortunately, over time, work on the project was stopped because I lost interest in watermarks.

I started publishing fewer photos mostly either for [commercial use](https://www.shutterstock.com/ru/g/aleksey-nemiro?rid=262891076) or under a [CC0 license](https://pixabay.com/ru/users/alekseynemiro-2293495/).
