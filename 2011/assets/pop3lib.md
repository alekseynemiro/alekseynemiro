# Pop3Lib

This is a .NET Framework library for receiving mail using POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3).

The source code is written in C#.

This project appeared thanks to [Kbyte.Ru](kbyte.md).

In the first versions of Kbyte.Ru there was a service for working with the forum via Email, and there was also an email question-and-answer system (also known as the Expert system).
And in the first version, there was a Web by Mail service - for receiving website pages by mail.

Essentially, I just shared my many years of developments.
