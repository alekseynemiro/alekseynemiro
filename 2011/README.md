# 2011

In 2011, I continued the development of my own projects around [Kbyte.Ru](assets/kbyte.md).

Firstly, I made a file server - [nefiles.ru](assets/nefiles.md).
This project made it possible to organize and store files in one place and simplified file management.
And I integrated it with all my own projects that required working with files.

Since I administered Windows servers myself, I often had questions that I had to look for answers to.
There were a lot of questions and as a result, I made a web project where I posted answers to questions on various topics.
It was [Yolper.ru](assets/yolper.md).

I used mixed .NET technologies for web development: ASP.NET WebForm, MVC (WebPages), Visual Basic .NET and C#.

I also worked more closely with SQL Server DBMS.

My own projects were already big, and new projects appeared. Resources were constantly in short supply.
I was looking for ways to optimize everything I could.

In my work at Arimsoft, I also encountered a shortage of server resources.
Although, of course, the company had far more resources than I had.
But also more complex projects and there really were a lot of them.

It was the time of startups. The company kept up with the general trend and I along with it.
We had a great project where we mainly needed to implement an airline ticket booking using Galileo Web Services.
This was a lower level, direct integration with Galileo.
Before this, integration with Galileo was high-level through simple partner APIs.

In addition, I worked more closely with JavaScript.
One of my work projects was to create an interactive map for finding and booking hotels based on Google Maps.
In fact, it was an application within an application. This was my first serious frontend project.

I created a lot of content and often encountered theft. This year my home page was stolen!
It sounds incredible, but it's true. The attacker made a complete copy of his website and forced search engines to consider this copy as the original.

I was seriously concerned about content protection.
For my own web projects, I wrote a small script that checked the domain name and if it differed from the original, it displayed [watermarks](assets/illegalcopy.png) on the site and then redirected to the correct site. The script was obfuscated.
Of course, if desired, such protection could be bypassed, but at least it helped against blatant lazy theft.

I sometimes like to take photos, so I developed [EasyWatermark](assets/easywatermark.md) to protect my photos.
This free program made in Windows Forms (C#) enjoyed some popularity.

To promote my programs, I needed websites. And to solve this problem I made a website builder - [ReleaseBox.ru](assets/releasebox.md).
To some extent, this was a continuation of the development of the [BogRay.ru](../2010/assets/blogray.md) platform.
